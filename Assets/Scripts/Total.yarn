Detective Caine: *Detective Caine sits alone at a small table, a dim lamp casting long shadows across the room. He stares at a map of Hollowbrook, marked with unsettling symbols.*

Detective Caine: (whispering to himself) Hollowbrook, you old ghost. What secrets are you hiding in your quiet corners?

[He takes a sip of coffee, the liquid barely able to cut through the heavy atmosphere.]

-> Find out what secrets Hollowbrook is hiding

Detective Caine: (looking at a newspaper clipping) October 17th, the night everything changed. A heartless killer haunts these streets, leaving fear in its wake. But there's something more, something beyond the mortal coil.

[He glances at a photo of Yanin, the 12-year-old girl.]

Detective Caine: Yanin Blackwood, a puzzle piece in this twisted game. Her spiritual ability is the key, the reason this malevolent force is on the hunt. But why her? What makes this village a breeding ground for the supernatural?

-> Ponder why Yanin is important to this mystery

[The room creaks, as if the very walls are listening.]

Detective Caine: (leaning back, rubbing his temples) I can feel it in the air, a malevolence that goes beyond human understanding. The town, it's like a living, breathing entity, hiding its sins beneath the picturesque facade.

[He stands, pacing the room.]

Detective Caine: (looking in the mirror) Caine, you old dog. You've seen your fair share of darkness, but this... this is different. It's like the shadows have a life of their own, dancing to a macabre tune.

[He grabs his coat, determination in his eyes.]

-> Recognizes that evil is taking hold of the Village

Detective Caine: Yanin needs answers, and so do I. There's a connection, a thread that ties this all together. I can't shake the feeling that I'm being watched, that every step I take, the town is watching, judging.

[He opens the door, the hallway outside eerily silent.]

Detective Caine: Hollowbrook, you can keep your secrets for now, but I'll unravel them, one by one. We're dancing on the edge of madness, and I won't let the night claim us without a fight.

[He steps into the hallway, the door closing with a creak, leaving the room in haunting silence.]

Alana: Yes, I recall. You shared details about your life, including the fact that I seemed to exist in your childhood home.
Yanin: Yeah, listening to the high school tightrope contest featuring the Easter Bunny mascot was quite an experience.
Alana: You make it sound like it was a bad event.
Yanin: *Mutter* It was.
Alana: Come on Yanin, don't be like that. I think it's time to tell you an important part of my life. My death.
Yanin: ...
Alana: I received an invitation to my boyfriend's 26th birthday party in the year 19XX, and being a thoughtful girlfriend, I purchased a unique and special gift for him.
Alana: He had a keen interest in vintage trinkets and gadgets, so I decided to gift him a vintage maroon clock.

Alana: The time was 1:07 in the morning. I will never forget it.
Alana: I can't recall the exact location, but he guided me to a lake. 
Alana: Engaging in typical activities, we settled down at the dock, gazing at the stars in the sky while engaging in casual conversation.

Yanin: What happened next?
Alana: I took his gift out from my pocket and his teeth spread into a wide smile.
Alana: At first I interpreted it as a smile of gratitude but the sharp cold feeling in my abdomen made me feel different.
Alana: And that was it. The only thing I saw alive was the cold blue eyes of my deciever as I sank into the lake floor.
Alana: My blood was seeping out of me, the shock allowing me to block all sense of feeling.
-> Where's your body now?

Alana: Nope, I don't recall where my body is. For all I know it's in the lake that I fell into.

Yanin: Why are you telling me this now?
Alana: Well, I don't know if you will believe me but I've seen him in this town a couple of nights before.
Yanin: Alive?
Alana: 
Alana: No.
Alana: "He appeared different, more sinister. I recognized him through a sense, but I don't know how or why he's here.
Alana: I have a deep fondness for you, Yanin. Since my death, you're the only one I've been able to talk to.
Yanin: Thank you for thinking of me like that.
Yanin: Do you think he's connected to the recent missing and murder cases?
Alana: I'm not too sure but if he is. You would need to find out his name. That's the only thing that would save you.
Yanin: Just as you brought me an orange from my kitchen when I mentioned Alana Bestello in the sentence.
Alana: We don't talk about that okay. That was a dark moment.
Alana: But in all seriousness, Yanin. You should steer clear my former partner. 
Alana: If he is apart of something more evil - besides murdering me - then you would need to find his name.
Yanin: *sigh*
Alana: Please, Yanin I'm counting on you. Only you could do it. That Caine guy may not know what he's getting into.
